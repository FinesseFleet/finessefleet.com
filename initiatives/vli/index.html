    <h1>Vidyasagar Learning Initiative (VLI)</h1>

    <p>The Vidyasagar Learning Initiative (VLI) is a pivotal educational project spearheaded by the Finessefleet
        Foundation. Established with the aim to provide high-quality, free, and accessible educational resources, VLI
        focuses on delivering comprehensive video lectures for students at the secondary school level (CBSE curriculum).

        universally accessible to students across geographical and socioeconomic boundaries.</p>
